# Memory Game

## Description

This is a simple memory card game where the user can flip 2 cards at a time to see their symbols. When the 2 selected cards have matching symbols, they will be added to the pair counter. Once all the pairs have been found, the user has completed the game and a success message shows with the user's results including; how many moves the user made to complete the game; how much time it took; and their star rating.
